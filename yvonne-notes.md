# Node Package Manager 

### What is Package Manager?

A package _manager_ is a tool that facilitates installing/uninstalling packages. In the programming world, it's also usually important that a package manager helps install/uninstall inter-package dependencies.

A package manager, in short, is just smaller pieces of the software which were written to fulfill _even smaller and more specific aspects_ of the program.

These smaller pieces of software can sometimes be sold or offered free to use, and are often referred to as packages.

A typical application, such as a website, will depend on dozens or hundreds of packages. These packages are often small. The general idea is that you create a small building block which solves one problem and solves it well.

Examples of package manager:
Chrome extensions
Text editor package manager (for atom or sublime)
Apple APP store

`npm init` is the first command you will use to create a Node project. It will 'initialize' your project by adding a file called `package.json` in the root directory.

NPM will ask you some questions in your terminal after you run the command â€” your answers will be pre-filled into the `package.json` like this:
